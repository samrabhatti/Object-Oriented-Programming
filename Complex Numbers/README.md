### Problem Statement:

Implement a class called ComplexNum. The ComplexNum class will have two data members:

* int real; 		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        // The real part of complex number

* int imaginary; 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	    // Imaginary part of the complex number.

You have to implement default constructor, overloaded constructor, copy constructor, destructor, setters, getters, display function and overload the operators +, - , <<, >>, =, ==, !=

All the operators should be overloaded by both member and non-member function.

**Hint:**

The following listed examples are simply following mathematical notation

3+2i + 5+6i = 5+8i

3+2i - 5+6i = -2-4i

**Note:**

•	Deallocate all dynamically allocated memory.

•	Make separate complex.h, complex.cpp and main.cpp files.

•	Follow all the code indentation, naming conventions and code commenting guidelines.
